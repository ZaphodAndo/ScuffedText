# scuffed-text ü¶Ä
What happens when you get a bored programmer who also happens to be a bit of a meme lord?... well this package I suppose.

## What is this package used for ?
This package is used for converting normal text into scuffed text also known as Alternating Caps and TroutSpeak üêü.

## What is scuffed text ?
```
ThIs iS An eXaMpLe oF ScUfFeD TeXt
```

## Why on earth would I want to do that ?
TBH I dont have a clue myself I just made this for the meme. ü§∑‚Äç

## Example usage
```javascript
import converter from 'scuffed-text';

let outcome = converter('this is an example of scuffed text');
console.log('Outcome: ', outcome);
```
In the example above we are requiring `scuffed-text` and assigning that to a variable that we then can pass our input into and it will return the converted string.

```bash
Outcome:  ThIs iS An eXaMpLe oF ScUfFeD TeXt
```
The outcome is shown above.
